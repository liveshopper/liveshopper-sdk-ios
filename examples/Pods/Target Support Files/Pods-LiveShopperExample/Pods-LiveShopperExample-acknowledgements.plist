Software License Agreement
Version 1.0, September 2019

Please read this software license agreement (“License”) carefully before using the LiveShopper
software. By using the LiveShopper software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this
License. If you do not agree to the terms of this License, do not use the software. As with any
software that integrates with the LiveShopper platform, your use of this software is subject to
the LiveShopper Developer Principles and Policies [https://developers.liveshopper.com/policy].

1. General.

A.  The LiveShopper software and documentation accompanying this License whether on disk,
    in read only memory, on any other media or in any other form (collectively the “LiveShopper Software”)
    are licensed, not sold, to you by LiveShopper, LLC. (“LiveShopper”) for use only under the
    terms of this License. LiveShopper retains ownership of the LiveShopper software itself and
    reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.

B.  LiveShopper, at its discretion, may make available future upgrades or updates to the LiveShopper
    software. Upgrades and updates, if any, may not necessarily include all existing software features or
    new features that LiveShopper releases. The terms of this License will govern any software upgrades
    or updates provided by LiveShopper that replace and/or supplement the original LiveShopper software
    product, unless such upgrade or update is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms
    of that license will govern.

C.  Title and intellectual property rights in and to any content displayed by or accessed through the
    LiveShopper software belongs to the respective content owner. Such content may be protected by copyright
    or other intellectual property laws and treaties, and may be subject to terms of use of the third
    party providing such content. This License does not grant you any rights to use such content nor
    does it guarantee that such content will continue to be available to you.

2. Permitted License Uses and Restrictions.

A.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, you are granted a worldwide, non-exclusive,
    royalty-free, non-assignable &amp;amp; non-transferable commercial copyright license to use the
    LiveShopper software, prepare derivative works and distribute the work and such derivative works
    in source or object form.

B.  To the extent that the LiveShopper software may be used to reproduce materials, such use is limited
    to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials
    you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce.

C.  No Reverse Engineering. You may not, and you agree not to or enable others to, copy (except as
    expressly permitted by this License), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the
    source code of, decrypt, or modify the LiveShopper software or any services provided by the LiveShopper
    software or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited
    by applicable law or by licensing terms governing use of Open-Sourced Components that may be included
    with the LiveShopper software).

3. Termination.

This License is effective until terminated. Your rights under this License will terminate
automatically without notice from LiveShopper if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this License.
Upon the termination of this License, you must cease all use of the LiveShopper Software and destroy
all copies, full or partial, of the LiveShopper Software. Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this License
shall survive any such termination.

4. Disclaimer of Warranty.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LiveShopper SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”
AND “AS AVAILABLE”, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND LiveShopper AND LiveShopper’S
LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS “LiveShopper” FOR THE PURPOSES OF SECTIONS 3 AND 4) HEREBY DISCLAIM
ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE LiveShopper SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, EITHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND
NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

5. Limitation of Liability.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
shall LiveShopper be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
to use the software (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, device
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if You have been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

6. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.

While redistributing the LiveShopper software or derivative works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of LiveShopper, and only if You
